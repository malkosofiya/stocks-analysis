# VBA of Wall Street
## Overview of Project
The goal of thei project was to find and analize the total daily volume and yearly return for diferent stocks using VBA. The completed analysis helps deside which stocks are best to invest in and which to pass on. Additionally, original script has been updated in order to make the report run faster and more efficient. 
## Code Overview
Although the original code worked well, the updated code is able to perform the same tasks faster for larger set of the data. By improving the logic of the code we were able to reduce processing time from 0.25 seconds to 0.08 seconds.

## Analysis and Results
At the first glance we can see that majoryty of stocks performed better in 2017 versus 2018, with TERP being the only stock producing negative returns both years. In 2017 SPWR had the highest total daily volume with nearly 800 millions of shares traded and an adequate return of 23%. In the contrast DQ had only 35 millions of shares traded but was able to produce almoust 200% in return.

In 2018 the only two stocks that had a posive return were ENPH and RUN. The previoust years hight preformers such as DQ and SEDG both turn out negarive returnes with -63% and -45% respectivly.

When looking at the date from both years ENPH might be a good options for investments since it performed concistenly well both years with high returns and high number of daily trades.
## Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
Refactoring helps to improve quality of the code therefore has some great advantages: 
* It makes code easier to understand
* It helps programm to run faster and smother
* It helps find issues such as duplicate code
* It can help fix bugs
That being sad refactoring also has some drawbacks that should be considered: 
* It can be expensive 
* It can be time consuming
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA scrip?
When working at this project refactoring helped improve the runtime and fficiancy of the code. However, refactoring code from it's original script also took a lot of time and additional testing.
